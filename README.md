# Nodalync Protocol

**A protocol for fair knowledge economics in the age of AI.**

---

### Abstract

A purely protocol-based system for knowledge economics would allow original contributors to receive perpetual compensation without requiring continuous production. We propose a solution using a five-layer knowledge model where source material (L0) forms an immutable foundation from which all derivative value flows. Cryptographic provenance chains link every insight back to its roots. A revenue distribution mechanism ensures that 95% of all transaction value flows to L0 contributors proportionally, regardless of derivation depth.

The protocol creates a knowledge layer between humans and AI systems, where agents query personal knowledge bases through a standard interface while automatically compensating all upstream contributors.

**L0 owners are the new landowners.** Contribute valuable knowledge once, benefit as the ecosystem builds on your foundation — forever.

### Status

This is an early draft seeking collaborators and feedback.

The protocol design is complete. Implementation has not begun.

Looking for people with experience in:
- Distributed systems
- Cryptographic data structures
- Knowledge graphs / semantic web
- AI agent development (MCP, tool use)
- Token economics / mechanism design

### Core Ideas

1. **Five-layer knowledge model** — L0 (raw sources) through L4 (emergent insights), with strict rules about what can be sold at each layer

2. **Cryptographic provenance** — Every derived insight links back to its foundational sources via content-addressed hashes

3. **Fair revenue distribution** — 95% of transaction value flows to L0 contributors; synthesis captures only 5%

4. **AI-native interface** — MCP integration enables any agent to query personal knowledge bases with automatic compensation

5. **Local-first sovereignty** — Your data stays on your node; buyers get query access, not downloads
