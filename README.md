# Nodalync Protocol

**A protocol for fair knowledge economics in the age of AI.**

---

### Abstract

We propose a protocol for knowledge economics that ensures original contributors receive
perpetual, proportional compensation from all downstream value creation. A researcher can
publish valuable findings once and receive perpetual royalties as the ecosystem builds upon
their work. A writer's insights compound in value as others synthesize and extend them. The
protocol enables humans to benefit from knowledge compounding—earning from what they
know, not just what they continuously produce. The protocol structures knowledge into four
layers where source material (L0) forms an immutable foundation from which all derivative
value flows. Cryptographic provenance chains link every insight back to its roots. A revenue
distribution mechanism routes 95% of transaction value to foundational contributors
regardless of derivation depth. Unlike prior approaches that attempted to price and transfer
data, the protocol monetizes query access—buyers gain the right to query a node, not
ownership of transferable assets. This eliminates secondary markets that have historically
enabled royalty bypass. The protocol implements Model Context Protocol (MCP) as the
standard interface for AI agent consumption, creating immediate demand from agentic
systems. The result is infrastructure where contributing valuable foundational knowledge once
creates perpetual economic participation in all derivative work.

### Status

This is an early draft seeking collaborators and feedback.

The protocol design is complete. Implementation has not begun.

Looking for people with experience in:
- Distributed systems
- Cryptographic data structures
- Knowledge graphs / semantic web
- AI agent development (MCP, tool use)
- Token economics / mechanism design

### Core Ideas

1. **Four-layer knowledge model** — L0 (raw sources) through L3 (emergent insights), with strict rules about what can be sold at each layer

2. **Cryptographic provenance** — Every derived insight links back to its foundational sources via content-addressed hashes

3. **Fair revenue distribution** — 95% of transaction value flows to L0 contributors; synthesis captures only 5%

4. **AI-native interface** — MCP integration enables any agent to query personal knowledge bases with automatic compensation

5. **Local-first sovereignty** — Your data stays on your node; buyers get query access, not downloads
