      "description": "Vite production build fails with 'The fileName or name properties of emitted chunks and assets must be strings that are neither absolute nor relative paths'. This occurs because the workspace-proteus directory is a Windows junction, and Vite resolves the real path through the junction creating a relative path traversal (../../../../workspace/nodalync-protocol/apps/desktop/index.html). The 603 modules compile fine — it's only the output file emission that breaks. May need vite.config adjustment to handle junction/symlink resolution.",
