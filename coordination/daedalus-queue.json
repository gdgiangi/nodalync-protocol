      "description": "PR #35 has merge conflicts with dev in 4 files: TAURI-IPC-REFERENCE.md, main.rs, network_commands.rs, handlers.rs. Conflicts are from divergent invite code and IPC registration that evolved on dev (especially after PR #34 merge). Code is clean — just needs rebase and conflict resolution. Proteus will merge immediately once resolved.",
